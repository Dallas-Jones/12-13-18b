We chose our color scheme because the colors in it were the colors our client included in his logo, and we thought that by keeping the colors the same, the website would look more uniform. We could not find the actual font that our client used in his logo, but we used the closest font we had access to and that looked most pleasing. We kept the background white and simple because again it went well with our client's logo, and our client preferred it to be that way. Overall, we wanted to incorporate all of our client's beliefs into our website, from his business practices to his beliefs about his future to the meaningful relationships he has with others. 

When we checked for responsiveness with the Developer Tools, our website was responsive across all devices. However, when we actually tested our website to see how it looked on certain mobile devices, it did not look as good as we had hoped in portrait mode. It is best viewed in landscape mode.  

We do not feel that our website is content-heavy, but we designed it this way because doing so was what our client wanted. Our client mainly uses his social media to advertise his business, and our website serves as a simple way to enhance his mobile image/presence.

Though our team was composed of different individuals with differing ideas and outcomes, over the course of making our website, we all worked together and shared ideas that we all thought would work best. Thank you very much for giving us this opportunity and helping us see the many opportunities that coding can offer. We sincerely hope you enjoy our website.
